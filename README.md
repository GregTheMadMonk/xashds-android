# XashDS Android - fork of FWGS's *xashds-android*
## Project is frozen! I'm not working on it anymore. No one seems to show interest in it. If you somehow are still using the app and have problems, you can always mail me or open an issue, I will try to help you despite I don't think I remember too much about what does what here.
Android dedicated server with x86 dynamic translator and dll support [**custom modification**].

## Current version - v1.2-forked (_Testing: v1.3-forked-beta_)
### Current changes since mittorn's version:

* **New interface theme** (Material for Lollipop, Holo for elder Android versions)
* **Server master** for more comfortable server setup
* File and folder **selection activities** - pick them without editing path string directly
* **"Connect" button:** supporting two connection types:
  1. Connect directly
  2. Connect using "xashds_hacks"
* New **console output view** - supporting colorized text and **copying lines to clipboard**
* **Shortcut creator** for server
* **Command line support**: send command to server directly from app - control server without connecting to it
* Server running **in service** - you don't need to keep application opened while server is running. Also, last log message will be shown in **notification area**

*Also, i've added new-built-by-me xashds (0.19) binary. But it still can't load some ddl's. :( Working on fixing it*

*Contact me (yagreg7@gmail.com) if some fatures are not working or on bugs detected. Enjoy.*
